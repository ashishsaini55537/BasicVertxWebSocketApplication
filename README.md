# BasicVertxWebSocketApplication

This is a basic group chat application using websocket.
I have used vertx to start a websocket server with some basic user handling.

You can run it using main function in VertxBasedWebSocketServer.java file.


I have made a folder named UI which has a html file which runs the ui part. To run this you can use python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080 or any equivalent server.
